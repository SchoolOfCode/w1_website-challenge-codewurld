# Website Challenge Process Review

## Objectives

We were tasked with the challenge of building a profile website using HTML and CSS for our pair partners whilst approaching it as if they were real-world clients. 

## Process

My partner, Claudiu and I, approached the task by creating and send eachother a Google form with basic open and close-ended questions to understand the type of site each client wants (i.e. professional/personal, etc.) and also acquire the necessary information to be included on the site.

With information at hand, we both went off to create the client's website, iterating along the way amidst a constant exchange of communication (for client feedback) until a satisfactory final version was created and submitted. 

## Research & Plan

Prior to beginning work on my client's website, I researched (visually and by inspecting the elements) the layout of several other [live websites](http://www.garysheng.com/) that were similar to the client's requirements, in order to get some inspiration and observe some best practices. 
Having completed my research, I sketched a basic wireframe of how I wanted the website to look like on a piece of paper and made use of [Coolors](www.coolors.com) to determine a good and coherent color scheme to design the website with.

## Main Challenges & Solutions

* At certain times, my code wasn't working properly or displaying as expected in the browser
 * First port of call was to do independent research to find a solution to the specific problem, using resources such as YouTube, W3School, Freecode Camp, etc. 
 * In the event that that fails, I shared the problem and reviewed the code with my pair partner (Claudiu) in one of our frequent standups and we both attempt to find a solution. 
 * I also recall attempting to find solutions to problems I had re: flexbox with my group members and other members of the cohort via Zoom meetings.
 * In conclusion, I deliberately took in that order, the three steps above when finding a solution to a problem, because I wanted to sharpen my independent thinking and solving skills, my teamworking skills and my skills in communication and problem-sharing and solution creation with wider communities.
 
* Information overload -- given the abundance of information available, I realised I was allowing myself to go down a rabbit hole, which became overwhelming and caused some sense of demotivation.
 * To circumvent this, I decided to be more selective with the information being consumed and to trust the process whilst reminding myself that I was a beginner and I don't necessarily need to know everything all at once.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Solution oriented team-working
2. Improved my technical skills with HTML, CSS, Markup and GitHub
3. Acute reminder to put the user/client at the forefront of decision making
